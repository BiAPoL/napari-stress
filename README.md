# napari-stress

This plugin provides tools for the analysis of surfaces in Napari, such as utilities to determine and refine the surface-representation of objects using a ray-casting approach and calculate the curvature of surfaces. 
It re-implements code in Napari that was written for [Gross et al. (2021): STRESS, an automated geometrical characterization of deformable particles for in vivo measurements of cell and tissue mechanical stresses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.437148v1) 
and has been made open source in [this repository](https://github.com/campaslab/STRESS).

## Usage

Functionality in this repository is divided in two groups: **Recipes** and **plugins**.

### Recipes


Receipes are workflows for processing images, points and surface data step-by-step.

| Recipe| Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/raw/main/docs/tutorials/recipes/_image_to_surface_imgs/workflow.png" width="100%"> | **Confocal data** (*.tif*), 3D+t: [Interactive tutorial](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/raw/main/docs/tutorials/recipes/Image_to_surface.md) on how to extract surfaces from intensity image data |
|<img src="https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/raw/main/docs/imgs/confocal/workflow.png" width="100%">| **Confocal data** (*.tif*), 3D+t:  [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/raw/main/docs/tutorials/recipes/Process_confocal.ipynb) for processing single channel data and extracting gaussian curvature.|


### Plugins

All functions in napari-stress are documented separately for [interactive usage from the napari viewer](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/raw/main/docs/tutorials/point_and_click) as well as [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/raw/main/docs/tutorials/demo).

### Utilities

Data to be used for this plugin is typically of the form `[TZYX]` (e.g., 3D + time). 
Napari-stress offers convenient ways to use functions from other repositories (which are often made for 3D data) on timelapse data with the `frame_by_frame` function and the `TimelapseConverter` class. 
Both are described in more detail in [this notebook](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-stress/blob/main/docs/notebooks/demo/demo_timelapse_processing.ipynb).

## Installation

Create a new conda environment with the following command. 
If you have never used conda before, please [read this guide first](https://biapol.github.io/blog/johannes_mueller/anaconda_getting_started/).

```
conda create -n napari-stress Python=3.9 napari jupyterlab -c conda-forge
conda activate napari-stress
```

You can then install napari-stress using pip:

```
pip install napari-stress
```
